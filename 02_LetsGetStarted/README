This chapter teaches the basics of working with XCode
and Interface Builder. The aspiring Nu programmer will
need to know corresponding information about TextMate.

I have opted to create these first few chapters in 
Interface Builder to demonstrate how IB can be used
from Nu. Many would prefer to construct the interface
in code, and there are plenty of examples how to do so.
(See the RandomApp in the Nu source, for example.)
